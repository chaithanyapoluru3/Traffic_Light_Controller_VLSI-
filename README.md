# TRAFFIC LIGHT CONTROLLER

The purpose of this project is to design a methodology using Verilog to control the traffic with specified time delays for a Plus (+) -Shaped Road.

## INTRODUCTION:
Managing traffic control is a significant challenge in many urban areas due to the sheer number of vehicles and the highly dynamic nature of traffic systems. Inefficient traffic systems often lead to accidents and significant time losses. This approach aims to reduce vehicle waiting times at traffic signals. The hardware design for this system has been developed using Verilog Hardware Description Language (HDL) programming.
<br> This project involves designing a basic traffic light control system for a (+)-shaped intersection. The system's output has been tested using VIVADO 2016.2.
<br> A traffic light, also known as a traffic signal or stop light, is a signaling device installed at road intersections, pedestrian crossings, and other locations to indicate when it is safe to drive, ride, or walk using a universal color code.
<br> In modern traffic systems:
<br> •	A red light means all traffic must stop.
<br> •	A yellow light indicates that cross-town traffic should slow down.
<br> •	A green light signals that it is safe to go or proceed.

In this diagram:
                 <br> R1 represents North.
                  <br> R2 represents East.
                  <br> R3 represents South.
                  <br> R4 represents West.


## BINARY INDICATIONS:
<br> 0 - RED(00)
<br> 2 - YELLOW(10)
<br> 1 - GREEN (01)

Vert_Line is  NORTH&SOUTH 
<br> Horz_Line is  EAST&WEST
